How to find the parked car.

It is a very usual problem not to find the car parked a while before. Sometimes because we are in a new 
city, or neighborhood, and we do not know the streets. Or we just do not remember exactly where we 
left the car parked.
This application allows to record the localization of the car once parked, and when returning to the car 
the app shows the path from the current localization to the parked car. This path is updated as it is 
gone through.

The app presents three simple commands:
- A switch to activate or desactivate the localization sensor.
- An anchor button to record the current localization.
- A clear button to delete the localization recorded.


Once the localization sensor is turned on, if no localization is recorded, the current localization is 
shown on a map. The anchor button is enabled and the clear button is disabled.
The current localization can be recorded (or anchored) by clicking the anchor localization button.
If a localization is recorded, once the localization sensor is turned on, the app shows the path from 
the current localization up to the recorded one. The anchor button is disabled and the clear button is 
enabled.
Details about the recorded localization, such as name of the street, number, ZIP code, state and country, 
are exhibed on a sliding panel by clicking the detail button.
Once the car is found, the recorded localization can be cleared by clicking the clear button.

This application presents the Google maps site on the web panel, which is written in the current language 
of the device.
